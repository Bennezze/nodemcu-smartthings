-- The `apiHost` and `apiEndpoint` can be obtained by doing an authenticated API call
-- to `https://graph.api.smartthings.com/api/smartapps/endpoints`. See the README for more details.
apiHost     = "https://graph-na02-useast1.api.smartthings.com"
apiEndpoint = "/api/smartapps/installations/88888888-cccc-dddd-55555-44444444444/event"

-- Set `report_on_startup` to true to report the status of each sensor to SmartThings upon startup.
-- This also reports the internal LAN IP address and MAC address of your NodeMCU device
-- When false, the program will only report when the sensor state changes.
report_on_startup = true

-- Set `blink_led` to true to blink the blue onboard LED upon successful communication with SmartThings
-- This is useful for visual confirmation and testing, but I leave it off in production
-- The onboard LED is tied to pin D4 so you cannot use this pin for other things when enabled
blink_led = false

-- `sensors` is a table of the sensor devices, their SmartThings device IDs and their corresponding pin on
-- the ESP8266 board. The pins are labeled with a `D` followed by a number. Only specify the numerical part as the `gpioPin`.
